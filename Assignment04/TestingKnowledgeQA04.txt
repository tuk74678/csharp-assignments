1. Describe the problem generics address.
    - Generic allows us to design classes or methods but defer the specification of type until the class or
      method is declared or called.
    
2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
    - To create a list of strings you can:
      List <string> theString = new List<string>();
    
3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
    - Dictionary class have two typ parameters, one for key type, another for value type.

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
    - False.

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
    - Add()

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
    1. Remove(T item)
    2. RemoveAt(int index)

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
    By using <T> after the class name.

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
    - False.

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
    - True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
    - True

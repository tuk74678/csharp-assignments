  2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
  boxing and unboxing?
      The different between value type and reference type are:
            - Value type stored in stack memory, but reference type stored in heap memory.
            - Value type directly holds the value while reference type holds memory address or reference of the value
            - Value type will not be collected by the garbage collector, but reference type will be collected by the
              garbage collector.
            - Value type will be created by struct or enum while reference type can be created by class, interface, 
              delegate or array.
            - Value type cannot accept any null value, but reference type can.
            
      - Boxing is an operation that coverts a value type into reference type (object type).
      - Unboxing is an operation that coverts a reference type into a value type.
  3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET?
      - Managed resource is organized by garbage collector.
      - Unmanaged resource is outside CLR control. It handles file, database connection etc. 
  4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
      The purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET is to:
        - Prevent memory leak.
        - Free up memory from unused objects from heap.
        - Divide the heap memory into three different generations such as: generations: 0, 1 and 2.
        - and it runs automatically.

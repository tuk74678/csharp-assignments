	SQL Prep:

	1. What is index; types of indices; pros and 
		on disk structure and db object that increases teh data retrieval speed from a table SELECT.
		Clustered Index → rearranges the physical order of rows (only 1 per table, usually on the primary key).

		Non-Clustered Index → separate structure, stores pointers to data rows.
		Pros: Faster SELECT queries, improved joins.

		Cons: Slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, uses extra storage.
		
	2. What's the difference between Primary key and Unique constraint?
	
		- UNique constraint can accept one and only null value, but PK cannot accept any null value.
		- One table can have multiple unique keys but only one primary key.
		- PK will sort the dat by default, but unique key will not.
		- PK will create a clusterd index by default and unique key will create a non-clustered.

	3. Tell me about check constraint
		Used to restrict values in a column.

	4. Difference between temp table and table variable
		- Temp table: special type of table that we can store the data temporarily. @ is the identifier
			- Stored in TempDB
			- Lifescope is session
			- Supports Index
			- Better for large data.
		- Table variable: A variable which is of table types.
			- Same lifescope of regular variable.
			- The lifescope of this is limited to the same batch, stored procedure.
			- Limited Index support.
	
	5. Difference between WHERE and HAVING
	
		- WHERE filters rows before grouping.
		- HAVING filters groups after aggregation.

	6. Difference between RANK() and DenseRank() — value gap
	
		- RANK() give rank based on certain order.
		- DENSE_RANK() is used when you dont want a value gap.

	7. COUNT(*) vs. COUNT(colName)
	
		Count(*) : counts all rows including nulls
		Count(column); counts only non-null values

	8. What's the difference between left join and inner join? JOIN and Subquery, which one has a

	better performance, why?
		- INNER JOIN: only matching rows.
		- LEFT JOIN: all rows from left, matcing from right
		Performance: 
			- JOINs are usually faster than subqueries. (Optimized by SQL engine)
		
	

	9. What is correlated subquery?
		- A subquery that depends on the outer query.

	10. What is a CTE, why do we need CTE?
		- It is a Common Table Expression. Temporary result set defined within a query for readability
		- Used for recursion, readability and reusing subqueries.

	11. What does SQL Profiler do?
		- SQL Profiler is tool to monitor, trace and analyze SQL Server Events(like slow queries, deadlocks)

	12. What is SQL injection, how to avoid SQL injection?
		_ SQL Injection occurs when hackers inject some malicious codes into our SQL quesries and thus destroying our database.
		- To avoid SQL Injection: we can use parameterized queries or stored procedure.

	13. Difference between SP and user defined function? When to use SP when to use function?
		- SP uses in DML, but UDF use for calculation logics.
		- For SP we can use EXEC to call but UDF we use it in SQL statement.
		- SP may or may not have input and output. UDF may or may not have input but must have output.

	14. Criteria of Union and Union all? Difference between UNION and UNION ALL
		- UNION : removes duplicates
		- UNION ALL: keeps duplicates
		Both require same number/type of columns.

	15. Steps you take to improve SQL Queries
		- Look at the execution plan/ SQL profiler.
		- Create index wisely.
		- Avoid using unnecessary JOIN.
		- Avoid using SELECT *
		- Use a derived table to avoid grouping of lots of non-agg table
		- Use JOIN to replace subqueries.

	16. concurrency problem in transaction
		- Concurrency problem is when two or more users are trying to access the same data.
			- Dirty Read: Read uncommitted data.
			- Phantom Read: New rows appear.
			- Lost Update: Two updates overwrite.
		Use Transaction Isolation Levels.

	17. what is deadlock, how to prevent
		- Deadlock occurs when two transactions wait for each other indefinitely.
		- To prevent it: we can access resources in same order, and keep transactions short.

	18. what is normalization, 1NF, benefits using normalization
		- Normalization is a process of designing database to minimize data redundancy which in turn ensures data consistency.
			- 1NF : No repeating groups, atomic values.
			- Benefit: Efficient storage and consistency.

	19. what are the system defined databases?
		- There are: master, model, msdb, tempdb

	20. composite key
		- Composite working with two tables maintaining many-many relationships.
		- Junction table.

	21. candidate key
		- Any column or group that can uniquely identify a row(potential PK)

	22. DDL vs. DML
		- DDL is data definition(CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
		- DML is data manipulation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

	23. ACID property:
		- Atomicity: work must be atomic. Either all work is done or rollback.
		- Consistency: whatever happens in the middle of the transaction, this property 
			will never leave db in haldf completed state.
		- Isolations: two transactions will be isolated from each other by locking the resource. 
		- Durability: once transaction completed, the changes made for db will be permanent.

	24. table scan vs. index scan
		
		- Table Scan: reads all rows -> slower.
		- Index ScanL reads index -> faster
		
	25. Difference between Union and JOIN
		- UNION combines rows (vertical).
		- JOIN combines columns (horizontal).

	26. Examples of one-one, one-many, many-many relationships; how can we create such relationships in db
		- One-to-One: Person-Passport ---> Unique foreign key.
		- One-to-Many: Dept-Employees ---> Foreign key in child
		- Many-to-Many: Students-Courses ---> Junction table.

	C# Prep:

	1. reference type vs. value type
	
		- Referennce type: 
			- hold the memory address, or reference of the value.
			- stored in heap memory.
			- will be collected by the garbage collector.
			- can be created by class interface, delegate, or array.
			can accept null value.
		- Value type: 
			- directly hold the value.
			- stored in stack memory.
			- will not colelcted by the garbage collector.
			- can be created by struct or enum.
			- cannot accept any null value.

	2. boxing vs. unboxing
		- Boxing is an operation that converts a value type to the reference type(object type).
		- Unboxing is an operation that converts a reference type to the value type.

	3. walk us through the four principles of OOP with examples, focus on what does the principle mean, why do we need to use that, examples of us that
		
		- There are 4 main pillars of OOP:
			- Encapsulation: hide data from the outside world.
			- Inheritance: reuse behavior
			- Polymorphism: many forms(virtual, override)
			- Abstraction: hid complex logic using abstract/interface
		
		follow-up:

		1. different access modifiers: public, private, protected, internal
	
		2. overriding vs. overloading, which one is runtime and which one is compile time
			- overloading: same name, different params -> compile-time.
			- overridding: subclass modifies base -> runtime
			
		3. can we have multiple inheritance in C#
			- we cannot have multiple inheritance but we can have multiple interface

		4. virtual method vs. abstract method
			- virtual -> can override (optional)
			- abstract -> must override.

		5. difference between abstract class and interface, when to use which one 
			- Abstract class will provide a base class to its subclasses. It is a wise choice when we have a class hierachy
			  , but an interface will define some commonn behavior or functionalities that can be implemented by any class.
			- One class can only inherit from one abstract or concrete class but one class can implement multiple interfaces.
			- Methods in an abstract class can be abstract method or non-abstract method. But for method in an interface, they
			  by default public and abstract.

	4. What does constructor do in a class? Can it be overridden? Can it be overloaded?
			- Constructor is a special method which shares the same name of the classs and doesn't have any return types , not even void.
			- It is used to create an object of the classs and initialize class members.
			- Constructor can be overloaded which means the method can have the same name but different parameter.
			- Constructor can't be overrided which means it cannot be inherited.
			
	5. What does static keyword do in C#?
			- Static are members that belong to the class itself instead of any instance.

	6. what are delegates in C#, what are different types of built-in delegates
			- Delegates are a type safe function pointer that takes a function or method as a parameter. It creates a reference type.
			- There are 3 types such as:
				- Action(return void as parameter)
				- Predicate: It will take functions that have generic input but returns a boolean value as a parameter.
				- Func: It will take functions that has generic input and will return a generic value as a parameter.

	7. What is the extension method in C#? examples of built-in extension methods? How to create custom extension methods?
			- Extension methods: allows us to add functionality to the existing type without modifying, deriving and recompiling the original class.
			- Use lambda operator to return a result. 
	
	8. Ref vs. Out vs. Params
			- ref: pass initialized variable.
			- out: mnust be assigned inside method.
			- params: variable number of arguments.

	9. Pass by reference vs. Pass by Value
			- value -> copy passed
			- reference -> original modified

	10. array vs. arrayList
			- array: fixed size, and type-safe.
			- arrayList: dynamic,and not type-safe.

	11. how do you handle exceptions? Syntax.
			- To handle exceptions, we can use try catch block following with exceptions and finally

	12. what is generic, syntax to define, how can we limit the implementation of generics 
			- Generic is used to create type-safe reusable code. It allows us to design classes or method but defer the specification of type until 
			  the class or method is declared. 
			- We can limit the implementation of generics by using constraints where.

	13. Generic Collection vs. non-generic collection
			- Generic(List<T>): type-safe, faster.
			- Generic(ArrayList): needs casting, slower.

	14. What is LINQ, why use it
			- LINQ: (Language Integrated Query) used to query collections easilty.

	15. IEnumreable vs. IQuerable
			- IEnumerable: in-memory, executes in app, and uses LINQ to objects.
			- IQueryable: database, executes on sever, uses LINQ to SQL.

	16. First, FirstOrDefault, Single, SingleOrDefault
			- First(): Throw on empty, dont throw on mutiple.
			- FirstOrDefault(): dont throw on empty, nor throw on multiple.
			- Single(): throw on empty, and throw on multiple.
			- SingleOrDeafult(): dont throw on empty, but throw on multiple.

	17. Any() vs. All()
			- Any(): true if at least one element satisfies.
			- All(): true if every element satisfies.

	18. How to implement pagination in LINQ (answer is to use Skip() and Take())
			- var result = students.Skip(10).Take(10);
			- This is called pagination — splitting the data into pages.

	19. Deferred Execution and Immediate Execution
			- Deferred -> query runs when iterated(IEnumerable).
			- Immediate -> executes immediately(ToList(), Count()).
